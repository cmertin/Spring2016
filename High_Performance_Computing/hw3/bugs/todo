bug 1
* Needed to be the same tag so set tag=0 for both nodes
bug 2
* Has to send and receive the same data. Set MPI_FLOAT to MPI_INT
bug 3
* Need to call MPI_Init before calling MPI functions and MPI_Finalize at end
bug 4
* Needed to reduce the values on the root node. Added a MPI_Reduce
bug 5
* Bad to use MPI_BYTE as char could be different per machine. Used MPI_CHAR
bug 6
* Set offset = 0 since each node gets its own version of the array, it's useless
bug 7
* count was set to taskid which would give a "count" of 0 for the root
